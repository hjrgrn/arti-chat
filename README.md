# Arti Chat

Forked from [async-chat](https://github.com/hjrgrn/async-chat), asynchronous encrypted chat that leverages the Tor network through the project [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti).

This project is a prove of concept, is not complete and is not functional; running this program can damage your machine, **DON'T USE IT** (or do it, I'm a README not a cop).
